# Web Scraping Job Postings from Indeed

Scrapping Indeed Job postings with different location 

For this project, I wanted to explore data science-related jobs posted to a variety of cities on indeed.com, 
a job aggregator that updates multiple times daily. I conducted my scraping using the “requests” and “BeautifulSoup” 
libraries in python to gather and parse information from indeed’s pages, 
before using the “pandas” library to assemble my data into a dataframe for further cleaning and analysis
